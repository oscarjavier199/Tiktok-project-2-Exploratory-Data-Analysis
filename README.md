# TikTok Project II: Exploratory data analysis (EDA)**

## Overview

**The purpose** of this project is to conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a provided data set. The mission is to continue the investigation we began in **Project I** and perform further EDA on this data with the aim of learning more about the variables.

**The goal** is to explore the dataset and create visualizations.

## Introduction
This is the second part out of 5 projects. The Final purpose of the projects is to develop a Machine Learning algorithm capable of classifying and predicting if a video posted by a TikTok user is either a 'claim' or an 'opinion', In this project, we will examine the provided data and prepare it for analysis. We will also design a professional data visualization that tells a story, and will help data-driven decisions for business needs.

## Data Sources
The datasets used in this analysis include:
- **Tiktok Dataset:** Provided by Google as part of the 'Advanced Data Analytics and machine learning Professional Certificate'.
